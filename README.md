ITC260 Summer 2015 Gig Central Project

###Update 6/09/2016

#Here are our two main user stories:

   *As a business I need to post a gig so that I can fill a position

   *As a user I need to view a gig so that I can apply for a position

I made the repo public so we could easily deploy to our development hosts
This being the case, be sure no passwords, etc. are left here I also moved the .sql file to a folder named docs outside of the application folder.

When adding to the SQL for the project, add a new SQL file there, for example:

**gigCentral-08032015.sql**

Thereby versioning the SQL files and preserving the older versions
